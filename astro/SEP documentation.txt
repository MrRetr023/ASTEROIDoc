Source extractor documentation. NOTES.

 -The source extractor will be used to detect objects within the picture. This works better 
  after having subtracted the background of the images, as we do not want much noise in the images when
  trying to detect objects. 
 -Two methods will be attempted to try and identify more efficiency. First, the original functions of the SEP 
  library will be used, such as sep.extract(), len(objects). Furthermore, I will attempt to use a matched filter
  (convolution) to display what provides better results for object detection. I will use a default kernel size.
  I will attempt to apply a matched filter and then display both results to see which ones detect more objects
  and then evaluate the quality of the detection in regards to the noise of the images. 
 -Feel free to check the math of the derivation of the matched filter formula for the second method of th last point.
 -We can also apply an aperture photometry at last to evaluate the results.
