Sombrero Galaxy NOTES:

In the next files, the transform was not found for any of the handling exceptions methods:

 - 145.fit
 - 146.fit
 - 151NoAutoDark.fit
 - 152.fit 
	These images are too bright for a transformation to be found between them. Nonetheless, 151.fit did work.
 - 159.fit
 - 160.fit
 - There is no other fit file to process against 163.fit

For this ones, another alignment method is needed to perform the motion detection, perhaps I could implement the library KBMOD as a short answer without having to align the
images, or find a different method that does not require an applied transform.

DATA found:

 - Between 157.fit and 158.fit a streak might have been detected. I am yet unclear of its nature and the certainty of my interpretation of the result.
