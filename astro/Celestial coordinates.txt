From pixel value coordinates to celestial coordinates. 

 -I need to do more research on this but I believe that we should transform the images to celestial
  coordinates. This is a possible different way to determine movement as we can compare the coordinates
  of the detected objects.

	 -I have not read the whole documentation but this will be using matplotlib to take the celestial
	  coordinates of the FIT files.
